**Title:** Behavioral Framework for Mesa

## **Summary**  
Mesa currently lacks a first-class framework for modeling complex agent behaviors involving **continuous state changes, time-consuming tasks, and sophisticated decision-making**. This project aims to create a **Behavioral Framework** module in which various elements like **state management, task execution, and behavioral decision-making** can defined, enabling modelers to create **realistic and adaptive agents**. The framework will support features like **discrete and continuous states**, **task selection based on the current state of the Agent**.

## **Benefits to the Community**  
- **Expands Mesa's Capabilities:** Provides a structured way to model advanced agent behaviors.
- **User-Friendly API:** High-level APIs for easy behavior customization.
- **Supports Multiple Decision Frameworks:** Allows both **rule-based and utility-based** decision-making, which could be modified with user-defined functions.
- **Documentation & Tutorials:** Ensures easy adoption by the community.

## **Deliverables**  
1. **Task System For Time-Consuming Task**  
   - Tasks run within Mesa's step function (Use of DiscreteEventScheduler for Optimization).
   - Tasks is basically action + duration + other relevant information that an Agent performs.
   - Time-consuming Tasks take **multiple ticks** to complete.
   - Two types of tasks:
     - **Atomic Tasks**: Must fully complete or restart if interrupted.
     - **Interruptible Tasks**: Can be paused and resumed.
   - Task can be interrupted based on a priority system i.e If a Task of a higher priority is introduced.

2. **Behavioral Decision-Making Framework**
   - Framework where out of **all possible Tasks** one is selected.
   - Selection can be based on **multiple different approaches**.
   - Supports **rule-based and utility-based** decision-making.
   - Decision made can be **state dependent**.
   - Allows **user-defined decision functions**.
   
3. **Usability Enhancements**  
   - High-level API for easy agent behavior definition.
   - Benchmarks & performance testing.
   - Complete documentation and tutorials.
   
## **Technical Details**  
- The module will be built as a **separate extension** for Mesa.
- Will be integrated with Mesa's **existing scheduling system**.
- Support for both **rule-based and utility-based decision-making**.
- Includes **test models and benchmarks** to validate performance.

## **Expected Timeline**  
| **Phase** | **Week** | **Task** |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Community Bonding | Weeks 1-3 | Engage with the Mesa community, refine project scope. |
| Phase 1 | Weeks 4-7 | Implement state management and task system. |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 8-11 | Develop behavioral decision-making and optimize performance. |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 12-14 | Finalize documentation, testing, and community feedback. |

## **Future Work**  
- Implement **graphical visualization** for agent behaviors.
- Improve integration with external AI models.
